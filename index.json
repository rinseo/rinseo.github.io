Despite the fact previous studies have mostly relied on qualitative research for limited number of parents, there is a growing demand for systematical estimation of the effect of parental mediation. But for large-scale quantitative research, research design or data structure have not been properly discussed, nor have they been even considered. As a methodological alternative, this study introduces propensity score matching and complex survey analysis. Using the Children and Media in Korea 2020 survey data, gathered and maintained by Korea Press Foundation, we estimated the treatment effect of three restrictive mediation strategies: using (1) passwords, (2) content-filters, and (3) management programs or applications. While passwords and content-filters significantly reduced children‚Äôs overall media use, the effect of parental mediation adopting management programs or applications was insignificant; however, the estimated individual treatment effect was shown to be correlated with higher level of perceived effectiveness. This study clearly shows that researchers conducting secondary analysis of public survey data gathered via multi-stage cluster sampling should take account for both ‚Äòconfounding effect‚Äô and ‚Äòdesign effect.‚Äô Additionally, the methodological implications and suggestions for future studies were discussed.","tags":["propensity score analysis (PSA)","complex survey analysis (CSA)","parental mediation","children‚Äôs media use"],"title":"Evaluating the effectiveness of parental mediation on children‚Äôs media use: Propensity score matching with complex survey data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rinseo Park","Young Min Baek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"7173b1e7e8429c16e019351c4a655e66","permalink":"https://rinseo.github.io/publication/jspp/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jspp/","section":"publication","summary":"In counterfactual thinking, an imagined alternative to the reality that comprises an antecedent and a consequent is widely adopted in political discourse to justify past behaviors (i.e., counterfactual explanation) or to depict a better future (i.e., prefactual). However, they have not been properly addressed in political communication literature. Our study examines how politicians used counterfactual expressions for explanation of the past or preparation of the future during COVID-19, one of the most severe public health crises. All Congressional speeches of the Senate and House in the 116th Congress (2019-2020) were retrieved, and counterfactual expressions were identified along with time-focusing in each speech, using recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The results show that counterfactuals were more practiced among Democrats in the Senate and Republicans in the House. With the spread of the pandemic, the use of counterfactuals decreased, maintaining a partisan gap in the House. However, it was nearly stable, with no party differences in the Senate. Implications of our findings are discussed, regarding party polarization, institutional constraints, and the quality of Congressional deliberation. Limitations and suggestions for future research are also provided.","tags":["counterfactuals","time-focusing","Congressional deliberation","COVID-19","natural language processing (NLP)"],"title":"Talking alternatively what would happen versus talking straightly what happened: Tracking Congressional speech during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rinseo Park","Sangwook Kang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634256000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634256000,"objectID":"5a7a980f51f30db6a5538b2a62714eb8","permalink":"https://rinseo.github.io/publication/2020_10/","publishdate":"2021-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_10/","section":"publication","summary":"Satellite remote sensing has been widely used to conduct a broad range, real-time monitoring of air quality. Satellite data, however, have potential sources of error in measurement. For example, cloud cover may increase uncertainties or even disable remote sensing, because satellite sensors can be affected by reduced visibility and radiographic distortion. Thus, in the fields of atmospheric science, it is a common practice to discard unreliable pixels by introducing certain thresholds to those sources of measurement error. Although the threshold approach is one way to ensure the quality of satellite data, from a statistical viewpoint, this can cause bias and efficiency loss. Therefore, we proposed an alternative method to model satellite-based air quality estimates using a measurement error approach. For model evaluation, we employed kriging methods using satellite retrievals of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS).","tags":["measurement error","kriging","satellite remote sensing","air quality","nitrogen dioxide","public health"],"title":"A measurement error approach for satellite-based air quality modeling: Using GEMS-retrieved nitrogen dioxide (NO2) products","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629676800,"objectID":"9fb7ecc9b43d0e53820c1b5768788db9","permalink":"https://rinseo.github.io/project/book_missing/","publishdate":"2021-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/book_missing/","section":"project","summary":"Baek, Y.

Our study examines opinion dynamics with two vaccines from an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. Of the two vaccines A and B, vaccine B is more preferred than vaccine A but insufficient in supply. On the other hand, vaccine A is less preferred than vaccine B but sufficient in supply. Under the limited resource constraints, we conducted simulation studies to examine how mass media and interpersonal communication shape agents‚Äô risk perception and vaccination behavior. The ABM results show that imbalanced vaccine allocation leads to (1) overestimation of vaccine A‚Äôs perceived risk, (2) decreased and unstable vaccination coverage. Moreover, both effects are exacerbated by heterogeneity between prior choices and homophily in interpersonal communication network. Even without considering mis/disinformation or political propaganda, risk evaluation towards unfavorable vaccines can be biased due to allocational conditions or strategies, especially at early stages of vaccination program. Therefore, the media has a responsibility to ‚Äúaccurately‚Äù convey the prone-to-bias nature of vaccine statistics.

Many studies have produced inconsistent findings and yet there is no consensus. This paper takes a new theoretical and methodological approach to examine the effect of early voting reforms. While most of the previous studies have modeled voting choices using individual-level survey data, we used precinct-level election results to estimate the ‚Äòprobability of vote choice transition‚Äô based on ecological inference (EI, King et al. 2004). Using EI model, we focus on the changes in citizens‚Äô voting behaviors between three consecutive legislative elections from 2012 to 2020 in South Korea. Furthermore, by integrating the estimated probabilities data and precinct-level demographic characteristics data, we investigate the relationship between precinct characteristics and changes in citizens‚Äô vote choice across legislative elections. We found both the short- and long-term effects of early voting reforms on voting turnout reported in previous studies; additionally, highlighted on the role of ‚Äòfamily-size,‚Äô along with the size and age distribution of precincts.
