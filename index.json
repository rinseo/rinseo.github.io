However, they have not been properly addressed in political communication literature. Our study examines how politicians used counterfactual expressions for explanation of the past or preparation of the future during COVID-19, one of the most severe public health crises. All Congressional speeches of the Senate and House in the 116th Congress (2019-2020) were retrieved, and counterfactual expressions were identified along with time-focusing in each speech, using recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The results show that counterfactuals were more practiced among Democrats in the Senate and Republicans in the House. With the spread of the pandemic, the use of counterfactuals decreased, maintaining a partisan gap in the House. However, it was nearly stable, with no party differences in the Senate. Implications of our findings are discussed, regarding party polarization, institutional constraints, and the quality of Congressional deliberation. Limitations and suggestions for future research are also provided.","tags":null,"title":"Talking alternatively what would happen versus talking straightly what happened: Tracking Congressional speech during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rinseo Park","Young Min Baek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628553600,"objectID":"7c6b9358115db578348e463b4c64d041","permalink":"https://rinseo.github.io/publication/jcr/","publishdate":"2021-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jcr/","section":"publication","summary":"In South Korea, it has long been disputed that surveys are being abused and misused. This study examines the chronological change in response rates of election polls, conducted and released from 2018 to 2021 on National Election Survey Deliberation Commission. We focus on temporal changes in response rates between election periods and non-election periods, along with overall time trends. In terms of research design, our research has two distinctive features. First, we analyzed ‚Äòcontact rate‚Äô and ‚Äòcooperation rate‚Äô using two-phases model of survey response. Contact rates and cooperation rates are calculated at contact phase and response phase, respectively. Second, to gauge the survey mode effects, we estimated multi-level models separately per survey mode. By measuring the changes in contact rates and cooperation rates, presumably contingent on the contextual factor ‚Äòelection,‚Äô this study carried out a close inspection on survey results in South Korea. We found that response rates continue to decrease over time; however, they tend to increase during election periods, irrespective of survey mode. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Trends in survey response rates during election periods in South Korea: Two-phases of survey response model and survey modes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rinseo Park","Young Min Baek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600300800,"objectID":"f69c84a6d566bd96f1f76b804ad653a8","permalink":"https://rinseo.github.io/publication/kpsr/","publishdate":"2020-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kpsr/","section":"publication","summary":"Does early voting reform actually increase voter turnout? Many studies have produced inconsistent findings and yet there is no consensus. This paper takes a new theoretical and methodological approach to examine the effect of early voting reforms. While most of the previous studies have modeled voting choices using individual-level survey data, we used precinct-level election results to estimate the ‚Äòprobability of vote choice transition‚Äô based on ecological inference (EI, King et al. 2004). Using EI model, we focus on the changes in citizens‚Äô voting behaviors between three consecutive legislative elections from 2012 to 2020 in South Korea. Furthermore, by integrating the estimated probabilities data and precinct-level demographic characteristics data, we investigate the relationship between precinct characteristics and changes in citizens‚Äô vote choice across legislative elections. We found both the short- and long-term effects of early voting reforms on voting turnout reported in previous studies; additionally, highlighted on the role of ‚Äòfamily-size,‚Äô along with the size and age distribution of precincts. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Early voting and the citizens‚Äô change in vote choice in Korean legislative elections: An ecological inference (EI) approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rinseo Park"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
