  These are some of the things that I like! Outside of the lab, I love books (<em>mostly</em> Korean short novels/essays), art (<em>mostly</em> abstract art paintings), music (<em>mostly</em> jazz, contemporary, and indie), and running (<em>mostly</em> easy 5K runs). Please feel free to connect with me! <ul class="icons"><li><a class="icon brands style2 fa-instagram" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rinsuuh_/"></a></li><li><a class="icon brands style2 fa-goodreads" target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/172387966-rinsuuh"></a></li></ul>
